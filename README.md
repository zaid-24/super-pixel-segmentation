# super-pixel-segmentation
This technique reduces the number of distinct colors in an image, to produce a visually similar but compressed image.It uses K-Means Clustering to group pixels of similar color. The K centroids of the clusters represent 3D RGB color space &amp; would replace the colors of all points in their cluster resulting in the image with K colors.
